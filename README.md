# Überfrankenstein

"Dr. Frankenstein's crime was not that he invented a creature through some combination of hubris and high technology, but rather that he abandoned the creature to itself (emphasis original)"

"Therein lies the existential risk inherent in superintendent A(G)I, which proceeds from the same 'conceptual and attitu¬ dinal error.' A superintelligent 'monster' that encodes the masculinist, patriarchal, dominant, controlling— and thus eschews the ethical, affective, aesthetic, empathetic—is a super-Frankenstein without realisable limitations upon its potential for power." -apocryphal

"I actually would object to that, and I think they’re good arguments for why transhumanism in practice would ultimately be quite illiberal. But even beyond its classification as a kind of eugenics today, this idea of transhumanism was developed by the more authoritarian illiberal genesis of the 20th century. J. B. S. Haldane is one example, J. D. Bernal is another, and in particular, Julian Huxley. Huxley was president of the British Eugenics Society from 1959 to 1962, and was really one of the most vocal and vigorous advocates of eugenics throughout the 20th century. In the second half of the 20th century, in particular, he popularized this idea of transhumanism. So, there’s a direct genealogical link as well."

"What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What [Aldous] Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us."

"Similarly, in 1944 economist Ludwig von Mises described Brave New World as a satire of utopian predictions of socialism: "Aldous Huxley was even courageous enough to make socialism's dreamed paradise the target of his sardonic irony."[39]"

"Aldous Huxley- Modern Satirical Novelist of Ideas
By Jerome Meckier · 2006"

The essays on Aldous Huxley collected here were written between 1966 and 2005 and have been arranged in such a way that they approximate a book on Huxley as a modern satirical novelist of ideas. In this capacity, Huxley assessed the intellectual condition of his era, always excoriating folly but never losing sight of human potentialities, especially his own. Huxley's ingrained skepticism persisted into his later fictions, even after his conception of the nature of things improved. The amused and highly amusing Pyrrhonic aesthete turned into a Swiftian Prospero. Detached yet totally committed to bettering the human condition, Huxley epitomized the dedicated craftsman. This lifelong aesthetician, always a philosopher, continues to command attention as thinker, critic, and artist: both satirist and sage. (Series: "Human Potentialities". Studien zu Aldous Huxley & zeitgenossischer Kultur/Studies in Aldous Huxley & Contemporary Culture - Vol. 8)"

https://scholarspace.jccc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=honors_journal "The Use of Satire in Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World" (2011)

"Satire is successful when the writer can make an audience believe the idea presented is not only logical, but
practical; the most effective satirists can even convince the reader to consider the idea as a reasonable solution
to a problem. Often, satire is used to bring to light certain social or moral issues or absurdities, and even more
ridiculous resolutions to said problems. While certain satires are appealing in their obvious disgust of
humanity, other works are not so blatant in their mockery, presenting more realistic situations. One of the
most famous satirists of the 20th century, Aldous Huxley employed such tactics in Brave New World and Ape
and Essence, not to mention other famous novels and essays. In Brave New World, Huxley shows how
appalling it would be to remain ignorant in happiness, and lack the potential to develop as a frail, error-prone
being. The greatest satirical aspect of this book is that the human race, while trying to better itself and gain
knowledge, ends up becoming its own adversary and enemy. Because of this successfully ironic portrayal of
human nature, Huxley remains one of the most successful 20th century satirists."

"He is quoted in a letter to George Orwell to say,“Within the next generation I believe that the world's
leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as
instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as
completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and
kicking them into obedience.” In Brave New World, Huxley explores this idea of a society
controlled by pleasure, ignorance, and conditioning. "

What Huxley believed to be a more efficient way of conditioning humans, it is now satire that has the burden and the blessing of being the more efficient antagonis of longtermism and any other eschatological cult that arises out of AI doomerism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism 

"Pyrrhonism is an Ancient Greek school of philosophical skepticism which rejects dogma and advocates the suspension of judgement over the truth of all beliefs. It was founded by Aenesidemus in the first century BCE, and said to have been inspired by the teachings of Pyrrho and Timon of Phlius in the fourth century BCE.[1] Pyrrhonism is best known today through the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, writing in the late second century or early third century CE.[2] The publication of Sextus' works in the Renaissance ignited a revival of interest in Skepticism and played a major role in Reformation thought and the development of early modern philosophy."

"The goal of Pyrrhonism is ataraxia, an untroubled and tranquil condition of soul that results from a suspension of judgement, a mental rest owing to which we neither deny nor affirm anything.

Pyrrhonists dispute that the dogmatists – which includes all of Pyrrhonism's rival philosophies – claim to have found truth regarding non-evident matters, and that these opinions about non-evident matters (i.e., dogma) are what prevent one from attaining eudaimonia. For any of these dogma, a Pyrrhonist makes arguments for and against such that the matter cannot be concluded, thus suspending judgement, and thereby inducing ataraxia.

Pyrrhonists can be subdivided into those who are ephectic (engaged in suspension of judgment), aporetic (engaged in refutation)[5] or zetetic (engaged in seeking).[6] An ephectic merely suspends judgment on a matter, "balancing perceptions and thoughts against one another,"[7] It is a less aggressive form of skepticism, in that sometimes "suspension of judgment evidently just happens to the sceptic".[8] An aporetic skeptic, in contrast, works more actively towards their goal, engaging in the refutation of arguments in favor of various possible beliefs in order to reach aporia, an impasse, or state of perplexity,[9] which leads to suspension of judgement.[8] Finally, the zetetic claims to be continually searching for the truth but to have thus far been unable to find it, and thus continues to suspend belief while also searching for reason to cease the suspension of belief."

"In Ancient Greek philosophy

Skeptics in Raphael's School of Athens painting. Pyrrho is #4 and Timon #5
Pyrrhonism is often contrasted with Academic skepticism, a similar but distinct form of Hellenistic philosophical skepticism.[8][19][20] While early Academic skepticism was influenced in part by Pyrrho,[21] it grew more and more dogmatic until Aenesidemus broke with the Academics to revive Pyrrhonism in the first century BCE, denouncing the Academy as "Stoics fighting against Stoics.[22]" Some later Pyrrhonists, such as Sextus Empiricus, go so far as to claim that Pyrrhonists are the only real skeptics, dividing all philosophy into the dogmatists, the Academics, and the skeptics.[19] Dogmatists claim to have knowledge, Academic skeptics claim that knowledge is impossible, while Pyrrhonists assent to neither proposition, suspending judgment on both.[8][19][23] The second century Roman historian Aulus Gellius describes the distinction as "...the Academics apprehend (in some sense) the very fact that nothing can be apprehended, and they determine (in some sense) that nothing can be determined, whereas the Pyrrhonists assert that not even that seems to be true, since nothing seems to be true.[24][20]"

Sextus Empiricus also said that the Pyrrhonist school influenced and had substantial overlap with the Empiric school of medicine, but that Pyrrhonism had more in common with the Methodic school in that it "follow[s] the appearances and take[s] from these whatever seems expedient."[25]

Although Julian the Apostate[26] mentions that Pyrrhonism had died out at the time of his writings, other writers mention the existence of later Pyrrhonists. Pseudo-Clement, writing around the same time (c. 300-320 CE) mentions Pyrrhonists in his Homilies[27] and Agathias even reports a Pyrrhonist named Uranius as late as the middle of the 6th century CE.[28]"

The use of art to market AI, including the use of generative AI "art," is reminiscient of _Trompe-l'œil_ in painting. The 1991 Pixies Album, _Trompe le Monde_, featured uncanny but obviously studio-crafted eyeballs that have the sheen of real eyes without the obvious organic tissue:

Generative AI takes _Trompe-l'œil_ to another level, the autonomous digital age, and instead of man-made art, becomes  _Trompe le Pomp,_ or "fool the shoddy," which applies to the undiscerning eye and replaces the category for authentic altogether with its own artifice. Alternatively, _Pomp le Monde_ is also applicable, if "pomp" is used as a verb. The phrase "Fake it til you make it" is a term adopted to the nth degree, but cannot account for the possibile ramifications of a wrench being thrown into the cogs of a modern Prometheus.

The Many-Frankensteins Hypothesis

From the Subversion of Drama in Huxley's Brave New World (Edward Lobb, 1984):

"A highly conscious artist and an omnivorous reader, Huxley was well aware of
the difficulties involved in writing a work of this type. There were few precedents for
the juxtaposition of the novel form, the satiric mode, and the Utopian debate
(Erewhon is one possible example), so Huxley was in territory which was not only
dangerous but largely uncharted. It is a measure of his success that Brave New World
not only overcomes its potentially centrifugal tendencies, but actually uses its various
traditions to work out, in subtle fashion, themes which are more directly stated
elsewhere in the novel. Brave New World is thus—against the odds, and contrary to the
opinions of several critics—a work in which form and content are artfully combined."

"Huxley made this point, one year after Hiroshima, to explain the absence from
the novel of phenomena such as atomic energy, which was a theoretical possibility
even in 1932. His specifying of "the theme," however, has led to unfortunately
narrow interpretations of Brave New World. It is generally treated now as a scientific
dystopia, a cautionary reply to H. G. Wells's vision of infinite social progress under
the aegis of a benevolent caste of scientist-samurai.2"

[2] Huxley himself suggested that Brave New World had originated as a parody of Wells's Men Like Gods ( 1922)
and then assumed a life of its own. Jerome Meckier has challenged this account of the novel's genesis in "A
Neglected Huxley 'Preface': His Earliest Synopsis ofBrave New World," Twentieth Century Literature, 25, No. 1
(Spring 1979), 1-20; see p. 2 especially. It is often forgotten that Wells depicted the irresponsible use of
science (in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), for example), and wrote at least one dystopian novel (When the
Sleeper Wakes, 1899)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau "Wells described it as "an exercise in youthful blasphemy."[3]"  "Wells's description of The Island of Dr. Moreau as youthful blasphemy comes from his introduction to The Scientific Romances of H. G. Wells (1933; published in the United States as Seven Famous Novels by H. G. Wells, 1934). This Preface to the Scientific Romances is reprinted as a chapter of editors Patrick Parrinder and Robert M. Philmus's H. G. Wells's Literary Criticism (Sussex: The Harvester Press Limited, and New Jersey: Barnes & Noble Books, 1980), see p. 243 for the line quoted."

"On the other hand, the EA movement has convinced an increasing fraction of its community over the past five years that global poverty as a whole isn’t the most “effective” cause area. Instead, we should redirect our finite resources to ensuring that humanity survives long enough to colonize space, spread throughout the accessible universe, populate exoplanets and build giant computer simulations in which trillions and trillions of digital people live supposedly “happy” lives. Although not all EAs have pivoted toward longtermism, and hence away from global poverty, the most prominent members of the EA community like Toby Ord and William MacAskill — both of whom once focused primarily on global poverty rather than the far future — have been vigorously promoting the longtermist perspective, and as I’ve discussed on many occasions before, longtermism is becoming hugely influential in the world more generally."
https://www.truthdig.com/articles/giving-altruism-a-bad-name/ 

The the idea of a SuperAGI superintelligence might evoke images of a HAL9000 running in a datacenter somewhere, in many ways, the longtermist goal of uploading digital minds as a "more efficient" way of promoting happiness is in many ways the most extreme overcalculation of not just one frankenstein but many frankensteins with their colonization of not just earth, but of exoplanets. With no ability to determine the actual condition of each human, the concept increasingly resembles a Brave New World-esque society, where happinesss is coerced with soma and knowledge and free inquiry are banished. Furthermore, the "trillion happy mind" digital mind concept is ironically similar to an even more dystopian version of the planned suburban housing developments of Levittown, the khrushchevka of the 1960s Soviet Union, and the Japanese _danchi_.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#Debate_whether_the_other_worlds_are_real (not related but term used as inspiration for naming the MFH)

From Huxley's 1948 _Ape and Essence_, it is clear Huxley was aware of the frankenfeatures that nuclear radiation could cause: 

"Meanwhile, a strange society has emerged from the radiation and three of its men capture one of the scientists (Dr. Poole). Dr. Poole is introduced to an illiterate society which survives by 'mining' graves for clothes, burning library books as fuel, and killing off newborns deformed by radiation (that is, newborns with over three pairs of nipples and more than seven toes or fingers) to preserve genetic purity. The society has also taken to worshipping Satan, whom they refer to as 'Belial', and limiting reproduction to an annual two-week orgy which begins on 'Belial's Day Eve' after the deformed babies are 'purified by blood.'"

from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape_and_Essence 
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape_and_Essence#Story)

It is likely that Huxley would have said the same of the longtermist idea of giant computer simulations where people's minds are uploaded, apparently indefinitely and without checksum or error correction code being possible, even if it were somehow deemed ethical. As neuroscience has determined, memories cannot be replicated nor merely accessed without them being altered in the process, much like quantum encryption can reveal whether wiretapping took place. A tour guide of Mammoth Cave, Kentucky said the same (That you can't enter the cave without altering it in some way). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_Cave_National_Park

The proliferation of text-to-image modelling using AI is eerily reminiscient of teratogenic deformities creating not just an uncanny valley of images (see https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/ai-uncanny-valley) but a many abstractions away from the original semantics that gets lost in translation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley While the definition of beauty is certainly up to interpretation, an aesthetic would know more about kitsch than a machine trained on data-poisoned data sets. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein_complex  "The "Frankenstein complex" is similar in many respects to Masahiro Mori's uncanny valley hypothesis."

"In Asimov's robot novels, the Frankenstein complex is a major problem for roboticists and robot manufacturers. They do all they can to reassure the public that robots are harmless, even though this sometimes involves hiding the truth because they think that the public would misunderstand it. The fear by the public and the response of the manufacturers is an example of the theme of paternalism, the dread of paternalism, and the conflicts that arise from it in Asimov's fiction.[citation needed]"
