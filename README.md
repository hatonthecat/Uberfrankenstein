# Überfrankenstein

"Dr. Frankenstein's crime was not that he invented a creature through some combination of hubris and high technology, but rather that he abandoned the creature to itself (emphasis original)"

"Therein lies the existential risk inherent in superintendent A(G)I, which proceeds from the same 'conceptual and attitu¬ dinal error.' A superintelligent 'monster' that encodes the masculinist, patriarchal, dominant, controlling— and thus eschews the ethical, affective, aesthetic, empathetic—is a super-Frankenstein without realisable limitations upon its potential for power." -apocryphal
